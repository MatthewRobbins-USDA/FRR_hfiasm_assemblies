# Characterizing Scaffolds



There are several tools utilized to characterize scaffolds

* Blobtools - identify contaminants scaffolds unsupported by reads
	* diamond blastx to nr database
	* blastn to nt database
	* mapping original reads to scaffolds using minimap
	* BUSCO scores
* Kraken - identify contaminants
* EDTA - Repeat analysis
* blastn to plastid RefSeq - identify plastid scaffolds
* blastn to mitochondrial RefSeq - identify mitochondrial scaffolds
